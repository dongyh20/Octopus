Code:
```javascript
// helper functions (only if needed, try to avoid them)
...
// main function after the helper functions
async function yourMainFunctionName(bot) {
	// await teleport(yaw,distance) #plan1: find the sand and teleport
}
```

RESPONSE SAMPLE1:
Explain: Since this is the initial request, there's no prior code to explain or evaluate. The task is to find and mine sand in Minecraft using Mineflayer. I can find a sand block in pic6 at the direction yaw=5.24, and the distance is 28.5 and 28.52.


Subtasks:
1) perceive and go near by the sand block
2) dig a sand block
3) ...
...
Code:
```javascript
async function yourMainFunctionName(bot) {
	// await teleport(yaw=5.24,distance=28.5) #Subtask1: perceive and go near by the sand block
}
```

RESPONSE SAMPLE2:
Explain: Since we have successfully teleport nearby dark_oak_log. We will use the provided programs to complete the task efficiently.

Subtasks:
1) Perceive and teleport near the dark_oak_log.
2) Mine 3 dark_oak_log.
3) ...
...
Code:
```javascript
// No helper functions are needed for this task

// Main function
async function mineWoodLog(bot) {
	
  // Subtask 2: Mine 3 dark_oak_log
  await bot.chat("Mining wood log...");
  await mineBlock(bot, "dark_oak_log", 3); // To collect 3 dark_oak_log
}
