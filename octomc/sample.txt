Now, please output Explain, Subtasks (revise if necessary), Code that completing the next subtask, and Target States, according to the instruction above. Remember you can only use the functions provided above and pay attention to the response format.
Explain: We have successfully perceived the sand block and can use the mineBlock function to dig it. However, the current task goal is to find wood logs, not sand. Therefore, we need to revise the subtasks and code accordingly.
