To run the SFT for Otter Model, please check `https://github.com/dongyh20/Octopus/blob/master/octopus/Otter/scripts/Otter_MPT7B_EAI.sh`.
The RLEF code will be released soon.


The LLaVA version will be released once the official LLaVA video is released, as we used some internal code from the mentioned project.
